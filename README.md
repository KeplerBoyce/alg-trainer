# speedcubetrainer
A website for learning and practicing speedcubing algorithms.

### Useful features
- Spaced repetition trainer: prioritizes practicing algorithms you're struggling with.
- Randomized setups: incorporates as much randomization to the cube state as possible to train full recognition. For example, if you're training COLL, each case will have random edge permutation so that you don't accidentally use the edges for recognition.
- Randomized setup scrambles: rather than using the algorithm in reverse as the scramble, a "random" looking setup is generated to make sure the scramble doesn't give away the solution.

### Planned features
- At-a-glance progress: tracking of your knowledge levels for every algorithm so that you can see which algsets, subsets, or individual cases need practice.
  - Currently, the percentage learned is displayed for each algset, but I plan to add a more detailed progress page with color-coded visuals and such to show this better and also for subsets and individual cases.
- Custom algsets: ability to add your own algsets and algorithms beyond the ones that come with the website by default.
- Alternate algs: option to list alternate algs for cases. I also plan to add some good alternate algs by default for the provided algsets.
