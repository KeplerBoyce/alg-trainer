# Rubik's Cube Algorithm Trainer Website
A website for learning and practicing Rubik's Cube algorithms. Currently contains algorithms for all LSE cases for the Roux method, generated by a Rust program and displayed on a website built with SvelteKit.

### Planned features (top of list to be added first)
- **WIP**: Option to view alternate algorithms for a particular case and choose your preferred algorithm
- Algorithm trainer with spaced repetition
  - "Real" scrambles rather than reversing the algorithm
- Option to change orientation of cube in pictures (rather than only yellow top green front)
  - For algorithm trainer: also option for randomizing to a particular set of orientations, e.g. dual CN or full CN

### Planned algorithm sets (top of list to be added first)
- CMLL
- Full OLL
- Full PLL
- Winter Variation?
- More to be determined in the future -- might consider other puzzles such as megaminx full OLL/PLL
